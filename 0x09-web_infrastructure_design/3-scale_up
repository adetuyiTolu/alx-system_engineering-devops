# Application Server vs Web Server

File Link:https://github.com/adetuyiTolu/alx-system_engineering-devops/blob/main/0x09-web_infrastructure_design/scaleup.png

## Infrastructure Overview

This infrastructure consists of multiple servers, each dedicated to a specific component, with load balancers configured in a cluster for high availability.

---

## What is a Web Server?

A **Web Server** primarily handles HTTP(S) requests from clients (usually browsers). It serves:

- Static content such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images.
- Acts as a reverse proxy, forwarding dynamic requests to the application server.

**Why separate this?**

- Web servers are optimized for handling many simultaneous connections for static content.
- Offloads static content delivery from the application server.

---

## What is an Application Server?

An **Application Server** hosts and runs the business logic and dynamic content generation.

- Processes application code.
- Generates responses (e.g., HTML pages, JSON APIs).
- Interacts with the database to fetch/store data.

**Why separate this?**

- Application servers run resource-intensive tasks and can be scaled independently.
- Provides better security by isolating the application logic.

---

## Why Use a Load Balancer Cluster?

- Distributes incoming traffic evenly across web servers.
- Provides fault tolerance; if one load balancer fails, the other takes over.
- Improves availability and reliability of the system.

---

## Why Split Components to Separate Servers?

- **Performance:** Each server can be optimized for its role (web, app, database).
- **Scalability:** Individual layers can scale independently as traffic grows.
- **Security:** Limits exposure by isolating components.
- **Maintainability:** Easier to update, debug, or replace parts without impacting others.

## Summary of Additional Elements

| Element                     | Reason for Adding                                     |
|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| **Load Balancer Cluster**    | High availability and fault tolerance for traffic    |
| **Dedicated Web Server**     | Efficient static content serving and request routing |
| **Dedicated Application Server** | Focus on business logic and scalability            |
| **Dedicated Database Server**| Data storage and management isolated from other layers |

This architecture provides a robust, scalable, and maintainable environment for hosting modern web applications.
